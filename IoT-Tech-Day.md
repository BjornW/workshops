# IOT HACKATHON
## Hack the world of IoT with the Things Network

The Things Network is back at the IoT Tech Day with a new, bigger hackathon. Novel Internet of Things technology and abundant data connectivity open up a new world of opportunities. We challenge the tech-savvy and the creative minded people to start exploring the new world of IoT and change the way we use technology. During the hackathon we will use the open standard LoRaWAN.
 
## About The Things Network
The Things Network is on a mission to build an open, global and crowdsourced Internet of Things data network, owned and operated by its users. In July 2015, The Things Network managed to cover the entire city of Amsterdam with a new type of wireless technology called LoRaWAN (Long Range Wide Area Network). The network was built, bottom-up, funded by its users. Now, hundreds of cities in over 80 countries worldwide are covered and lots of use cases are built on top of it. Join us in our mission to create abundant data connectivity so applications and businesses can flourish.
