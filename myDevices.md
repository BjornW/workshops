2.  You can find your **Process ID** in the URL of the myDevices dashboard, starting after `/lora/`
3.  Add the integration


## Change the payload format 

In order to display your content in the Cayenne dashboard, we need to change the format of the payload. 

* Go the **The Things Network Console** and click **Payload Formats**
* Select in the dropdown menu **Cayenne LPP** instead of **Custom**

> We need to send extra data for Cayenne to understand what data comes into their dashboard. Before we send the sensor data, we need to define what data is sent. The first byte is the so-called **Channel ID**. The sencond bytes explains the **Data Type** (so Cayenne knows that the data contains temperature values). The latter bytes contain the actualy sensor values.
 Please have a look [here](https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/devices/arduino/api/cayennelpp.html) to find more information on the Cayenne Lower Power Protocol (LPP).



## Build your Cayenne dashboard
Click the device on the left side of your dashboard in Cayenne and you data is should be shown right away. After a bit of editing you can make quite some fancy stuff:
