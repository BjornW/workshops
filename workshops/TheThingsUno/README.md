   ![arduino-port](./media/arduino-port.png)


### The Things Network Dashboard

#### Create an account
Your applications and devices can be managed by [The Things Network
dashboard][dashboard].
To use the dashboard you need a The Things Network account.  You can [create
an account here][accounts].

After registering and validating your account, you will be able to
log in to [The Things Network dashboard][dashboard].


#### Create An Application

Users can create applications. Applications have an unique identifier, the EUI,
which is issued by The Things Network and is guaranteed to be unique.

Create your first The Things Network application by clicking
[create application](https://staging.thethingsnetwork.org/applications/create).
Fill in the desired application name (something like `Julia's temperature sensornet` if your name is Julia) and click **Create application**.

![create application](./media/create-application.png)

You will be redirected to the newly created Application page.

![application info](./media/app-info.png)

*Note: In the Application Info component, you can see the Access Key for that
application, this is a secret key to to get access to the data of your
application. You will need this key later.*

*Note: in every component on the dashboard there is a small help icon.
This opens a help message with details about that components.*



#### Register an OTAA Device

The Things Network supports the two LoRaWAN mechanisms to register devices:
activation by personalization (ABP) and over the air activation (OTAA). In this
workshop, we use ABP.  ABP device addresses are generated by The Things Network
for you.

To register the device, click **register device** on the application page.  This
will take you to the device registration page.  Here, select **OTAA** and enter
an App EUI.  We will let the App Key to be randomly generated.
To continue, click **Register**. 

![register-device](./media/register-device-otaa.png)

You will be redirected to the device info page.  Here you can view all
information about your device, send messages to the device and view messages
that were sent by the device.

![device-info](./media/device-info-otaa.png)

## Hello World

### Configure Device

1. In the Arduino IDE, open **File** > **Examples** > **TheThingsUno** >
   **hello-world-OTAA**
2. Change your `appEUI`, `appKey` to the values you can find on the application
   page. If you click the `<>` on the each of the fields on the Device page,
   their contents are shown as a C-style byte buffer literal which is extra
   handy for copy-pasting.

Use the information shown on the device page to fill in following code snippet:

```
// Copy paste the values found on the Application page here
const byte appEui[0] = { /* copy App EUI here */ }; // For example: { 0x70, 0xB3, 0xD5, 0x7E, 0xD0, 0x00, 0x01, 0xDF }
const byte appKey[0] = { /* copy App Key here */ }; // For example: { 0xJG, 0x4Y, 0xxZ, 0x6q, 0x8f, 0xcH, 0xBX, 0xRR, 0x1a, 0x2a, 0xru, 0xjG, 0xUM, 0xKo, 0x9F, 0xhG, 0xoL, 0xFU, 0xFL, 0x4M, 0xSl, 0x0= }
```

### Run The Application On Your Device

1. Click **Sketch** > **Verify/Compile** and make sure that compilation works
   (Arduino says *Done compiling*)
2. Click **Sketch** > **Upload** (Arduino says *Done uploading*)
3. Go to **Tools** > **Serial Monitor** to see the output of your node. This
   should look like this:

```
Sending: mac tx uncnf 1 with 12 bytes
Successful transmission
Sending: mac tx uncnf 1 with 12 bytes
Successful transmission
...
```

### Get Your Data

If all goes well you should also be receiving messages from your device in the
Messages component on the device page.  The payload you see here is
the the byte representation off the `Hello world!` we are sending with
from the device.

![Hello world payloads](./media/messages-hello-world.png)

Using the payload like this is can be tricky: usually the raw bytes are of no
interest to an application using messages from a device.  That's why The Things
Network introduces the concept of *payload functions*.  More on that later,
first let us send some actual data!


#### Embracing Bytes

Sending ASCII strings like `Hello world!` over the LORA is wasteful and is
considered a bad practice.  Instead, prefer to send bytes that encode your
data in a compact way.  For instance, if we have a temperature reading, that is
a `float`, depending on the precision we need we could encode the integer and
fractial parts as bytes in a two-byte payload. Like so:

```
// we measured this!
float temperature = 21.5;
int data = (int)(temperature * 100); // 2150
byte buf[2];
buf[0] = (data >> 8) & 0xff;
buf[1] = data & 0xff;
ttu.sendBytes(buf, 2);
```

Set up the above loop in your Arduino and click **Sketch** > **Verfiy/Compile**
and **Sketch** > **Upload** again.  This will make the UNO send bytes
representing our temperature value `21.5`.

##### Resetting the Frame counts

There's one caveat: because we reset the device, it starts sending frames
with a frame count starting at `0` again.  For security reasons, The Things
Network only accepts new frames if their frame count is higher than that of
previous frames.

To receive the new messages, we need to reset the frame counter for the device
on the netwerk. This can be done by re-registering the device: go to the device
page and click **reset** (after Frames up).  You should now start receiving new
messages from the device.

The payload should read `08 66` (the byte representation of `21.5`).


#### Unpacking The Bytes

To make working with byte payloads easier, The Things Network allows you to
register payload functions for each application.  The payload functions are
three functions: the *decoder*, the *converter* and the *validator*.

Here, we will only be using the *decoder* to unpack the bytes your device is
sending into messages that are meaningful to our application.

To set up the payload functions, go back to the Application view and click the
**edit** button in the Application Info component. This will bring you to the
Payload Function editor.

![payload editor](./media/payload-editor.png)

Here you can view, test and edit the payload functions for your application.

In the *decoder* section, enter the following to decode the payload:
```
function (bytes) {
  var data = (bytes[0] << 8) | bytes[1];
  return {
    temperature: data / 100.0,
  };
}
```

Before saving our payload function we can test it first by entering a test payload in the
box below. Enter `0866` and click **Test**. The test output should correspond to
the temperature value we sen earlier:

```
{
  "temperature": 21.5
}
```

![Payload function tests](./media/payload-test.png)

If you are happy with the output of your payload function, click **Save**. All
incoming messages will now be decoded using these payload functions.  You can see if this
worked by going back to the device page and looking at the messages.  The
payload will now be logged in its decoded form.

### Getting Your Data

In this tutorial, we are using Node RED to get the data from The Things Network
routing services and push it to an application back-end.

1. Follow the instructions from your workshop facilitator to get to your Node
   RED environment;
2. From the **input** category in the toolbox on the left, drop a new **MQTT**
   node on your workflow
3. Double-click the node named `mqtt`
4. Click on the pencil icon next to **Add new mqtt-broker...**
5. Enter for **Server**: `staging.thethingsnetwork.org`
6. Go to **Security**
7. Enter in **Username** your AppEUI (check the Application page)
8. Enter in **Password** your Access Key (check the Application page)
9. Click **Add**
10. Enter in **Topic**: `+/devices/+/up`. This subscribes you to all devices in
    your application
11. From the **function** category, drop a new **JSON** node on the flow and
    connect the output of the `+/devices/+/up` node to the input of the `json`
    node
12. From the **output** category, drop a new **debug** node on the flow and
    connect the output of the **json** node to the input of the **debug** node.
13. Double click the debug node and select **message property** from the Ouput
    dropdown. Enter `msg.payload.fields` in the box below. And click **Ok**.

Your flow should look like this:

![nodered-debug-flow](./media/nodered-debug.png)


Click **Deploy** and monitor the debug tab for incoming messages. You will start
seeing messages like:
```
{ temperature: 21.5 }
```


## Push to IFTTT

1. Go to [IFTTT Maker Channel](https://ifttt.com/maker)
2. Click **Connect**
3. Go to **Receive a web request**
4. Click **Create a new Recipe**
5. Type `Maker` in the search box to choose Maker as the trigger channel
6. Click **Receive a web request** as the trigger
7. Enter an **Event Name**, for example `temperature`
8. Pick an **Action Channel** and configure it
9. Use the fields `value1`, `value2` and/or `value3`
10. Click **Create Action**
11. Click **Create Recipe**
12. Go back to Node RED
13. Drop a new **Function** on the flow
14. Return `value1`, `value2` and/or `value3` as JSON object. For the previous
    example:
```
return {
    payload: {
        value1: msg.payload.fields.temperature
    }
}
```
15. Drop a new **HTTP request** on the flow;
16. Select the **POST** method and enter the URL as seen on **How to Trigger
    Events** in IFTTT, for example:
