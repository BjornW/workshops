## Introduction

This workshop walks you through the process of building a LoRa enabled
internet-of-things application, from device to end-user application.

The device will be powered by the Multi-Tech mDot. The end-user application's
logic will be modeled in Node RED and it will have a front-end built with
Node.js, Socket.io, React and Bootstrap.

## Pre-requisites

- LoRaWAN gateway connected to The Things Network
- Multi-Tech mDot with UDK2, or Multi-Tech EVB
- Micro-USB cable
